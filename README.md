# React + Redux list of TODOs

You are given an `app` folder with already implemented `store` and `hooks`. Implemented using the Redux. 

- `features/currentTodo` contains a sample of all the required types;
- implement `features/filter` storing `query` and `status`;
- implement `features/todos` storing an array of todos;
- load the todos in the `App` on page load (don't use Redux Thunk for now);
- `useAppSelector` already aware of `RootState` so you can write selectors in your
components (no need to write them in the store file)
